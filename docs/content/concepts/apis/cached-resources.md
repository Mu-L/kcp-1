# CachedResource API

!!! warning
    As of 0.29, this feature is of alpha-version quality. To use it, enable the `CachedAPIs` feature gate.

A CachedResource object replicates a user-defined resource from its workspace into kcp's [cache server](../sharding/cache-server.md). It may be used as an [APIExport virtual resource](./exporting-apis.md#virtual-resources) with the goal of distributing static, read-only resources to multiple clusters, in a scalable way.

**Example user story:**

- You, the **service provider**, run a cloud _Cloud Co._, including a compute service.
- You offer a service of provisioning and running VM instances: users create an `Instance` object and voilÃ , they have a running VM!
    - But how do you design the API for configuring such a resource? How do you make your consumers know what configuration options are available, given the limited resources available in the cloud?
    - You've decided to offer different packages for CPUs, memory, storage, GPUs; these are represented as CRDs, e.g. `cpuflavors.cloud.example.com`, `memflavors.cloud.example.com`, with `cpu-small`, `cpu-medium`, `cpu-large`, `mem-medium`, `mem-large`, `mem-xlarge` respectively.
    - You've created a CachedResource for each flavor type.
    - You offer the service through an APIExport containing the main `instances.cloud.example.com` resource, as well as all flavors. These are exported as [virtual resources](./exporting-apis.md#virtual-resources).
- **Consumers** binding to your APIExport can list and get the available flavors from within their workspace (e.g. with `kubectl get cpuflavors`), and refer to them in their `Instance` spec. They cannot create, delete or otherwise modify the flavor objects in any way.

See an example usage at [github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/tree/main/config/examples/virtualresources](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/tree/main/config/examples/virtualresources).

## Resource replication

```yaml
apiVersion: cache.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: CachedResource
metadata:
  name: cpuflavors-v1
spec:
  group: cloud.example.com
  version: v1
  resource: cpuflavors
```

The snippet above shows an example where all `cpuflavors.v1.cloud.example.com` objects in the workspace are replicated to the cache. There are some constraints on what resources may be replicated:

- There may be only one CachedResource for a particular group-version-resource triplet in the workspace.
- The resource must be cluster scoped.
- The resource must not be a [built-in API](./built-in.md) or kcp system API belonging to `apis.kcp.io` group.
- The resource may be originating from a CRD or an APIBinding.

Once created, resource replication progress may be checked in CachedResource's status:

```yaml
apiVersion: cache.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: CachedResource
metadata:
  name: cpuflavors-v1
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-10-21T14:03:41Z"
    status: "True"
    type: IdentityValid
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-10-21T14:03:42Z"
    status: "True"
    type: ReplicationStarted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-10-21T14:03:41Z"
    status: "True"
    type: ResourceValid
  identityHash: cd2eb0837...
  phase: Ready
  resourceCounts:
    cache: 8 # (1)
    local: 8 # (2)
```

1. `cache` resource count refers to the count of objects currently in cache for this CachedResource.
2. `local` resource count refers to the count of objects the CachedResource currently sees in its workspace.

The objects a CachedResource is watching are always replicated in the direction **from** CachedResource's workspace **into** cache. Note that this means the only way to modify the in-cache copies is to modify the original objects. In-cache objects can be then projected into a workspace as a read-only API. This is done by creating a respective APIExport with [CachedResource virtual resource](#exporting-cachedresources), and binding to it.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    cacheServer["Cache server"]

    subgraph provider["API Provider Workspace"]
        cpuflavorsCRD["CPUFlavors CRD"]
        cpuflavorCRs["CPUFlavor objects..."]

        cpuflavorsCachedResource["CPUFlavors CachedResource"]

        cpuflavorCRs -."From".-> cpuflavorsCRD
        cpuflavorsCachedResource -.Watches.-> cpuflavorCRs
    end

    cpuflavorsCachedResource -."Replicates CPUFlavor objects into".-> cacheServer
```

You can optionally configure the following additional aspects of a CachedResource:

- its identity
- its endpoint slice
- resource selector

We'll talk about each of these next.

### CachedResource identity

Similar to the [APIExport identity](./exporting-apis.md#apiexport-identity) concept, there may be many CachedResources with the same group-version-resource triplet across kcp instances. To differentiate between them and identify owners, a CachedResource object uses a unique identity key stored in a secret.

The identity **key** is considered a private key and should not be shared.

**Hash** calculated from that key, found at `.status.identityHash`, is considered a public key. APIExport's virtual resource definition expects this identity hash to be supplied when exporting a CachedResource.

By default, creating a CachedResource object triggers creation of an identity secret with a randomly generated key in its `key` data item. You can provide your own key by referencing your secret in the object's spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-cached-cpuflavors-identity
  namespace: default
stringData:
  key: "<Your identity key>"
---
apiVersion: cache.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: CachedResource
metadata:
  name: cpuflavors-v1
spec:
  identity:
    secretRef:
      name: my-cached-cpuflavors-identity
      namespace: default
  ...
```

### CachedResourceEndpointSlice

While CachedResources replicates their associated resources to the cache server, retrieval of these in-cache resources is done through the Replication [virtual workspace](../workspaces/virtual-workspaces.md). The Replication VW is an API server dedicated to CachedResources, and is able to access the resource's objects with read-only verbs get, list and watch.

The Replication VW endpoints are listed in CachedResourceEndpointSlice. This endpoint slice is compatible with APIExport's [virtual resources](./exporting-apis.md#virtual-resources) and can be used as storage source.

With that said, the Replication VW is consumer-aware, and needs a valid APIExport and APIBinding(s) to operate. Therefore it is much more convenient to access the in-cache resources through regular APIBindings in a workspace and/or the APIExport VW rather than accessing them through the Replication VW. Consider the Replication VW just as an implementation detail of the CachedResource API, and when consuming it, use APIExports.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    cacheServer["Cache server"]
    replicationVW["Replication VW"]

    subgraph provider["API Provider Workspace"]
        cpuflavorsCachedResource["CPUFlavors CachedResource"]
        cpuflavorsCachedResourceEndpointSlice["CPUFlavors CachedResourceEndpointSlice"]

        cpuflavorsCachedResourceEndpointSlice --> cpuflavorsCachedResource
    end

    replicationVW -."Reads from".-> cacheServer
    cpuflavorsCachedResourceEndpointSlice -."Has an endpoint for".-> replicationVW
```

For convenience, creating a CachedResource triggers creation of a CachedResourceEndpointSlice object under the same name. This behaviour can be disabled by adding `cachedresources.cache.kcp.io/skip-endpointslice` annotation to the CachedResource object. You can create your own like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: cache.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: CachedResourceEndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: cpuflavors-v1
spec:
  cachedResource:
    name: cpuflavors-v1 # (1)
```

1. Name of the CachedResource this endpoint slice is referencing. Currently, both CachedResource and CachedResourceEndpointSlice must be co-located in the same workspace. See <https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/issues/3658>

### Selectors

CachedResource spec has an optional [`labelSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors) field which can be used to shape the set of objects it picks up.

```yaml
apiVersion: cache.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: CachedResource
metadata:
  name: cpuflavors-v1
spec:
  group: cloud.example.com
  version: v1
  resource: cpuflavors
  labelSelector:
    cloud.example.com/visibility: Public
```

## Exporting CachedResources

You can project the replicated read-only objects of a CachedResource into a workspace using the standard APIExport-APIBinding relationship. Create an APIExport and define [virtual resource](./exporting-apis.md#virtual-resources) for the associated [CachedResourceEndpointSlice](#cachedresourceendpointslice). Consumers can then bind to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apis.kcp.io/v1alpha2
kind: APIExport
metadata:
  name: compute.cloud.example.com
spec:
  resources:
  - group: cloud.example.com
    name: cpuflavors
    schema: v250801.cpuflavors.cloud.example.com # (1)
    storage:
      virtual:
        reference: # (2)
          apiGroup: cache.kcp.io
          kind: CachedResourceEndpointSlice
          name: cpuflavors-v1
        identityHash: cd2eb0837... # (3)
```

1. Resource schema must match the schema used by the resource in the associated CachedResource.
2. Reference to the CachedResourceEndpointSlice endpoint slice `cpuflavors-v1`.
3. Identity hash of the `cpuflavors-v1` CachedResource object.

A `virtual` storage definition needs (1) a reference to an [endpoint slice](./exporting-apis.md#endpoint-slices) object, and (2) a virtual resource identity. In the case of CachedResources, the endpoint slice is provided by CachedResourceEndpointSlice. For convenience, a matching CachedResourceEndpointSlice object is automatically created when creating a CachedResource. The identity hash must match the one set in CachedResource's `.status.identityHash`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph provider["API Provider Workspace"]
        export["CPUFlavors APIExport"]
        schema["CPUFlavors APIResourceSchema"]
        crd["CPUFlavors CRD"]
        cpuflavorsCachedResourceEndpointSlice["CPUFlavors CachedResourceEndpointSlice"]

        export --> schema
        export --> cpuflavorsCachedResourceEndpointSlice
        schema -."Is equivalent to".-> crd
    end

    subgraph consumer1["Consumer Workspace"]
        binding["CPUFlavors APIBinding"]
        boundCPUFlavorVirtualResources["CPUFlavor objects..."]

        binding -."Projects CPUFlavors API from Replication VW".-> boundCPUFlavorVirtualResources
    end

    export --> binding
```

Note the APIResourceSchema referenced by the APIExport example above: the Replication VW follows that reference, and that schema is then used to serve the resource in consumers' workspaces. The provider must therefore ensure that it is kept in-sync with the schema of the original resource.
