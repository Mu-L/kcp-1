// Package terminatingworkspaces and its sub-packages provide the Terminating Workspace Virtual Workspace.
//
// It allows for cross-cluster LIST + WATCH of LogicalClusters which:
//   - are marked for deletion via a DeletionTimestamp
//   - request termination by a specific controller
//
// That is, a request for
// GET /services/terminatingworkspaces/<terminator>/clusters/*/apis/core.kcp.io/v1alpha1/logicalclusters
// will return a list of LogicalCluster objects which are Terminating and for which status.terminators contains the
// <terminator-name>.
// WATCH semantics are similar to (and implemented by) timestamp and terminators selectors - a LogicalCluster that stops
// matching the requirements to be served (not being marked for deletion, not requesting termination by
// the controller) will be removed from the stream with a synthetic Deleted event.
